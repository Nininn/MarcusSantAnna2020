\usage{
aggte_het(MP, type = "simple", balance.e = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{MP}{an MP object (i.e., the results of the \code{unc_att_gt_panel_het} method)}

\item{type}{Which type of aggregated treatment effect parameter to compute.
The default is "simple" (this just computes a weighted average of all
group-time average treatment effects with weights proportional to group
size).  Other options are "dynamic" (this computes average effects across
different lengths of exposure to the treatment and is similar to an
"event study"; here the overall effect averages the effect of the
treatment across all positive lengths of exposure); "selective" (this
computes average treatment effects across different groups; here
the overall effect averages the effect across different groups); and
"calendar" (this computes average treatment effects across different
time periods; here the overall effect averages the effect across each
time period).}

\item{balance.e}{If set (and if one computes dynamic effects), it balances
the sample with respect to event time.  For example, if \code{balance.e=2},
\code{aggte} will drop groups that are not exposed to treatment for
at least three periods. (the initial period when \code{e=0} as well as the
next two periods when \code{e=1} and the \code{e=2}).  This ensures that
the composition of groups does not change when event time changes.}

\description{
A function to take group-time average treatment effects
 and aggregate them into a smaller number of parameters.  There are
 several possible aggregations including "simple", "dynamic", "selective",
 and "calendar."
